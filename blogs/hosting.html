</div>
<div id="divi">
    <p>Web hosting is just a service where you are able to rent space on the internet and fill it with all your media and go live with your website. All of your text, pictures, videos, buttons have to be stored on a physical server somewhere that is connected to the internet. I.e you need your data to be stored somewhere. Web hosting companies have buildings filled with this servers. They even provide you with design platforms, support, security and much more.</p>
    <p>Web hosting is not to be confused with buying a domain name. When you buy a domain name, that is just like securing the address where your store will be set up. Web hosting is what allows you to set up that shop and make it visible to anyone in the world. So if you buy a domain name, and you didn’t get hosting,  and then you type in your domain name, it will just take you to a screen that says this website is PARKED AND NOT ACTIVE.  </p>
    <p>Hosting is the home of your website. If you want a website, you need somewhere to host it. Hosting is bacsically  the computer and networking infrastructure that keeps your website available across the internet.</p>
