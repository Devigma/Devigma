            <h2> RICHARD IBEH </h2><hr>
            <P>I am Richard Ibeh C.E.O of the outstanding establishment DEVIGMA.</P>
           <p>i have been into software development since teenage my age. i've built websites and have a vast knowledge when it comes to database management. Richard loves developing mobile applications for people even before meeting his two friends. He has developed so many mobile applications and has lost count of the number he has worked on.</p>
           <P>His two friends are thankful to God for making their path cross. Richard spends his whole day building mobile applications for customers which has improved his skills tremendously. Richard is also into geographical information system and ML using ANN. He started this few years back when he met his friends. </P>
           <P>Now, He and his friends work hand in hand to build and develop mobile applications for people, and has established Devigma a place where the building of websites and mobile software has no end.   
            Our industry employs qualified and experienced software developers working together to provide the best of its services to its customers  24/7.</P>

            <h2> EIRENE AKINS </h2><hr>
            <P>I am Eirene Akins a software developer that deals exquisitely in front-end web development. I was a teacher and content writer, teaching Further Mathematics and Physics before i started my journey into the software world where i felt more happy and at ease with the knowledge i have gained. i have built  standard websites for a lot of people before meeting my two friends. Richard Ibeh has really been the one who spiked my interest in front-end development.</P>
           <p>i started my journey into website development when i went to his barber shop to trim my hair and saw a man sitting  behind me with his laptop on his lap talking to one of his friends and telling him about website development. I paid so much attention to what the man said and then went on to buy a desktop and started learning website development online. Since then I have built  a lot of websites for people.</p>
           <P>In a friendly visit i met my friends, who told me about joining the establishment. Few months later, Devigma was established. That’s how I became a part of the industry.</P>

            <P>Hey Guys, I am Joshua Kenneth a web/app developer and here’s my story. <br>
                I was only into web development from the start until the moment i met Richard Ibeh Who developed my interest in mobile application. </P>
           <p>All thanks to Richard I have successfully built lots of premium mobile applications for industries with Richard as my ally. My love and enthusiasm about software development has helped spiked my interest a lot in the establishment of Devigma..</p>
           <P>Well not long after getting to know Richard, he invited me to join him in the building of the industry DEVIGMA, so together we can make it easy for an individual to own a software for his business or project. </P>
           <P>Alongside Richard  was Akins himself who he had worked with, on some complex projects some years back. <br> 
            Thats how I joined the industry.</P>
